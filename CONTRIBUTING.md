# Contributing to this repository
Thanks for wanting to contribute to the cyclic generation model project :) 

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes (sTBD).
4. Make sure your code lints (TBD).
5. Issue that pull request!

Please reference the issues in the pull requests!

## Guide to branching and commiting

For branches that are connected to a feature issue, name it features/issueNumber-describe_the_feature.

For branches that are connected to a bug issue, name it bugs/issueNumber-describe_the_bug.

As for the commits: use this convention "#issueOne #issueTwo: Short description of changes."
Use present tense if possible.

As you can see: no pull request will be merged without proper branching and an issue.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/patrykferenc/cyclic-dungeon-generation-model/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug using appropriate template.

## Use a consistent coding style
TBD: Prepare linting style.
Will be mandatory using Prettier or something else.
